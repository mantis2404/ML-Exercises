- prevents neural network from overfitting, stops the training when it knows that the network is being overfitted.

> - **monitor**: Quantity to be monitored. Defaults to `"val_loss"`.
> - **min_delta**: Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an improvement Defaults to `0`.
> - **patience**: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped. Defaults to `0`.
> - **verbose**: Verbosity mode, 0 or 1.Defaults to `0`.
> - **mode**: One of `{"auto", "min", "max"}`. In `min` mode, training will stop when the quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in `"max"` mode it will stop when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in `"auto"` mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity. Defaults to `"auto"`.
> - **baseline**: Baseline value for the monitored quantity. If not `None`, training will stop if the model doesn't show improvement over the baseline. Defaults to `None`. Usually set to `None` only.
> - **restore_best_weights**: Whether to restore model weights from the epoch with the best value of the monitored quantity. If `False`, the model weights obtained at the last step of training are used. An epoch will be restored regardless of the performance relative to the `baseline`. If no epoch improves on `baseline`, training will run for `patience` epochs and restore weights from the best epoch in that set. Defaults to `False`.
> - **start_from_epoch**: Number of epochs to wait before starting to monitor improvement. This allows for a warm-up period in which no improvement is expected and thus training will not be stopped. Defaults to `0`.
